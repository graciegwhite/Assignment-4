abundance_line_g
#Abundance has recently increased in IVEE and CARP, but decreased or stayed similar at other sites. Why is there a peak in 2015, and an overall decrease in 2016? Was there an event that we should be aware of? Why is CARP increasing so much when it's not an MPA, and conversely, why is the NAPL MPA decreasing? Perhaps an El NiÃ±o event? A change in fishery regulations? A lobster disease?

###Part 4
```{r}
#chi-square test for independance
#The legal minimum carapace size for lobster is 82.6 mm. What proportion of observed lobsters at each site are above the legal minimum? Does that proportion differ significantly across the 5 sites? 
#first, set up a table of proportions for 2017. The table should have the sites as the the row names, and then the columns shoulf be the proportions below and above the legal minimum carapace size (82.6mm)

lsize_prop_table <- lsize_expanded %>% 
  select(-YEAR, -COUNT) %>% 
  mutate(Legality = ifelse(SIZE > 82.6, "Above Legal Minimum", "Below Legal Minimum")) %>% 
  count(SITE, Legality) %>% 
  spread(Legality, n) %>% 
  select(-SITE)

rownames(lsize_prop_table) <- c("AQUE", "CARP", "IVEE", "MOHK", "NAPL")

#H0:There is no different in proportions
#HA: There is a difference in proportions

#look at the actual proportions

lob_prop <- prop.table(as.matrix(lsize_prop_table), 1)

#run a chi-square test for independence 

lsize_x2 <- chisq.test(lsize_prop_table)
lsize_x2

#p-value = 0.0009864, reject the null! We have significant evidence to suggest there is a difference in proportions of lobsters above/below the legal size limit between sites


```

 #in console, running lsize_x2$stdres to see which sites differ significantly:
 Above Legal Minimum Below Legal Minimum
AQUE           0.1464223          -0.1464223
CARP           1.8631463          -1.8631463
IVEE          -1.2357993           1.2357993
MOHK          -3.2327773           3.2327773
NAPL           2.5706474          -2.5706474

Standardized residuals greater than |2| mean significant (I think?)
